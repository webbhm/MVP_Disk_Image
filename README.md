# MVP_Disk_Image
Image file of the MVP SD Card

This is the SD card pulled from my MVP, run through Win32 Disk Imager, then through 7-Zip to make the zip file.
You should be able to use Etcher to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-63rlluTVV5dHBxQWROM29MNUk?usp=sharingextract the image to an SD card (32G suggested) and then have a complete MVP software environment.
You are left to connect to the internet.

This first version is a quick and dirty version to meet user needs, and will likely be tested and polished more in the future.

NOTE: the MVP.zip file is 4.38GB (compressed).  This is too big for Github to accept (32MB max) so I have put it out on Google Drive.  It took 2.2 hours to upload - be patient when downloading.
